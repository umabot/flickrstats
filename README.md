# Flickr Photo Stats Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts to interact with the Flickr API and retrieve photo statistics.

## Flickr Daily Photo Stats (`flickrGetDailyPhotoViews.py`)

**Purpose:**
This script fetches daily popular photo statistics (views, favorites, photo ID, title, secret, and server) from your Flickr account for a user-specified date range. The collected data is then saved into a CSV file.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.x
*   pip (Python package installer)

**Setup & Installation:**
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> 
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_directory>` with the actual URL and local directory name).

2.  **Navigate to the repository directory** (if not already there).

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate 
    ```
    (On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`)

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **API Credentials:**
    This script requires Flickr API credentials to access your account.
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your Flickr API key and secret to the `.env` file as follows:
        ```env
        FLICKR_API_KEY='YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY'
        FLICKR_API_SECRET='YOUR_FLICKR_API_SECRET'
        ```
    *   **Important:** Replace `YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_FLICKR_API_SECRET` with your actual Flickr API key and secret.
    *   The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental committing of your sensitive credentials.

**How to Run:**
1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated if you are using one.
2.  Execute the script from the root directory of the project using:
    ```bash
    python3 flickrGetDailyPhotoViews.py
    ```
3.  The script will then prompt you to enter the date range:
    *   `Enter start date (YYYY-MM-DD):`
    *   `Enter end date (YYYY-MM-DD):` (Enter the same date as the start date if you want data for a single day).

4.  **Authentication:**
    *   If this is your first time running the script, or if your previous authentication token is invalid or has expired, the script will guide you through an OAuth authentication process:
        1.  It will print a URL to the console.
        2.  Copy and paste this URL into your web browser.
        3.  Authorize the application in Flickr.
        4.  Flickr will provide a verifier code.
        5.  Copy this verifier code and paste it back into the script when prompted: `Verifier code:`
    *   Once authenticated, the script will store the token for future sessions, so you won't need to repeat this process every time unless the token becomes invalid.

**Output:**
*   The script generates a CSV file containing the fetched statistics.
*   The filename is dynamically created based on the input dates:
    *   If the start and end dates are the same: `flickr_stats_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
    *   If the start and end dates are different: `flickr_stats_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
*   **Columns in the CSV file:**
    *   `Date`: The date for which the stats were fetched (YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `Photo ID`: The unique identifier for the photo.
    *   `Photo Title`: The title of the photo.
    *   `Daily Views`: The number of views the photo received on that date.
    *   `Daily Favorites`: The number of favorites the photo received on that date.
    *   `Secret`: The photo's secret, needed for constructing URLs.
    *   `Server`: The server ID for the photo, needed for constructing URLs.

## Author & Project Notes

**Data Backup & Personal Documentation (Author-Specific):**
*   The author periodically saves a full set of generated data to Google Drive (personal account, file `Flickr Stats v2`).
*   Additional project documentation and notes by the author may be found in their Obsidian vault (note titled `Flickr Photo Project - my stats`).

**Repository Notes:**
*   The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude:
    *   The `.env` file (containing sensitive API credentials), as detailed in the script setup.
    *   `*.csv` data files (generated by the script).
    *   Standard Python virtual environment directories (e.g., `venv/`) and cache files (e.g., `__pycache__/`).
